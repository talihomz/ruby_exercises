Objects:
- Board (:draw, :initialize, :mark_slot)
- Slots (:value, :identifier)
- Player (:name, :marker)

Steps:
1. Add 2 players to the Game
2. Create a Board
3. Create all Slots
4. Start game loop (asking player for input)
- what are the inputs for a player?
  a. identity a slot
  b. enter an 'x' or 'o'

5. After each iteration, display the board
6. If a player has won, stop the game and declare winner
- winning = check if all slots are aligned (vertically, horizontally or diagonally)

Rules:
1. Each turn has only one player
2. A slot can only have one value ('x' or 'o')
3. A player can only enter a value to a blank slot
4. If there cannot be a possible winning combination, end game as draw
